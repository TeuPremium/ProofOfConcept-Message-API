THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT PROJECT FOR A  GUIDED SELF TAUGHT EXPERIENCE ORIENTED TOWARDS LEARNING TYPESCRIPT.
IT IS VERY RUDEMENTARY AND LACKS MANY IMPORTANT FEATURES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL IN ACTUAL PROJECTS.

*Unfortunately I did not have the time to troubleshoot my .env related problems .So, it is important to note that I ended up using a file called enviroment.ts in the src folder to export the variables, I added an example of how to create the file to run it.
